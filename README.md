# Chef_To_Ansible
This app automatically converts Chef recipes into equivalent Ansible playbooks using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. Place your Chef .rb files in the chef folder, and the app will generate corresponding Ansible .yml playbooks in the ansible folder, preserving all logic, resources, and comments.
